### Model
- Game Environment
- This trust game is a model of the game used to study trust, reciprocal preference, altruistic preference and egoistic preference.
In the version of the game I designed, there were two anonymously matched players, named A and B, playing the role of real life principal and agent. There are two rounds of the game with similar rules. After the first round, players are allowed to know the outcome of the first round and the strategy chosen by their opponents in the first round. Therefore, they can adjust their strategy in the second round. That is, in my current hypothesis, the strategies chosen by both players in the first round will directly affect the strategies chosen by both players in the second round and the level of trust between players.
At the beginning of the game, A has $1,000 and B has $0. A has to choose whether or not to give B some of his money, which I'll call X. B, knowing A's choice, can choose whether to get double or triple X, which is 2X or 3X. If A chooses to receive 2X, he has no mandatory requirement to return A certain amount but is free to choose whether or not to return A portion of his money, which I'll call Y. If A chooses to get 3X, then he is forced to give back at least 1.5X. That is, if A chooses to get 3X, then he is forced to return to A at least 1.5X+Y. The value of Y can be determined by B himself (it must be greater than or equal to 0). At the end of the first round, both players immediately know the other's choice and their existing balance, and then play a second round with exactly the same rules.
